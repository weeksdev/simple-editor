# GitHub Actions Fix - Deprecated Artifact Upload

## Issue Fixed
The GitHub Actions workflow was using a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact@v3` which was causing build failures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Artifact Upload Action
```yaml
# Before (deprecated)
- name: Upload DMG artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3

# After (current)
- name: Upload DMG artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

### 2. Updated Python Setup Action
```yaml
# Before
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v4

# After
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v5
```

### 3. Updated Release Action
```yaml
# Before
- name: Create Release
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1

# After
- name: Create Release
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **No More Deprecation Warnings**: Uses current, supported action versions
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Latest versions with ongoing support
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Improved action performance and reliability
- ✅ **Security Updates**: Latest security patches and improvements

## Verification
The workflow now uses:
- `actions/checkout@v4` (latest stable)
- `actions/setup-python@v5` (latest stable)
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4` (latest stable)
- `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` (latest stable)

All actions are now using current, non-deprecated versions that will continue to be supported.
