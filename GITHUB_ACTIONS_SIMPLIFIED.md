# GitHub Actions Simplified

## Problem
The original GitHub Actions workflow was using a complex `--onedir` approach that:
- Required manual app bundle creation
- Had complex library path management
- Was fragile and hard to maintain
- Often failed due to missing dependencies or path issues

## Solution
Updated GitHub Actions to use the new simple build approach:

### Key Changes
1. **Simplified Build Process**: Now uses `build_simple_macos.sh` script
2. **Onefile Mode**: Uses `--onefile` instead of `--onedir` for reliability
3. **Reduced Complexity**: From ~100 lines to ~30 lines of build logic
4. **Consistent**: Same build process for local and CI

### Updated Workflow Steps
```yaml
- name: Build macOS app
  run: |
    # Use the simple build script
    chmod +x build_simple_macos.sh
    ./build_simple_macos.sh

- name: Rename DMG for release
  run: |
    # Rename the DMG to include the version number
    if [ -f "Simple Editor-1.0.0.dmg" ]; then
      mv "Simple Editor-1.0.0.dmg" "Simple Editor-${GITHUB_REF_NAME}.dmg"
    fi
```

### Benefits
- ✅ **More Reliable**: Single executable with all dependencies included
- ✅ **Simpler**: Uses the same build script as local development
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Less complex code to maintain
- ✅ **Consistent**: Same build process everywhere
- ✅ **Faster**: Fewer steps and less complexity

### Files Updated
- `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml` - Simplified workflow
- `build_simple_macos.sh` - New simple build script

The GitHub Actions workflow now uses the same reliable build process that works locally!
